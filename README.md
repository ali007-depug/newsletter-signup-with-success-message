## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
1. using BEM methdology (block,element,modifier)

2. using linear gradient and hover on it with pesudo element

3. know that hover effect with gradient won't work on ``` <input type="submit">```
but it work with ```<a>```

### Continued development
write more clean and orgnaized code
